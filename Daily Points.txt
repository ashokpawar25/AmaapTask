Explanation about book inventory system.
started with lowest hanging fruit i.e 
refactored code by achiving the abstraction
SOLID =
S -> Single Responsibility
Created the mocks

1.Test Doubles
Fake =Not unit testable but want to do unit testing the do the complete class as fake
     = when want to send some http calls, mocking masseging service
stub = instead of faking all the classes we use some inbuilt classes
     = when using any external library(My Sql Connector)
     => rearly used due to security issue
mock = instead of implementation focus on making mock instance of class
     = when we are working with objects and we want to verify sequence of operations and controll the execution
     => It is mostly used

More About Tdd:
-Baby Steps--->(Calculator Example)
1)Any smallest step on which we can write a test case .

-Yagini and Future preparedness===>(Email for Error Example)
1)Deleting something or put it for future use

-The Law Of Lowest Hangin Fruit
1)Write the simplest test cases first
2)Implement obvious test first

Home Work - Write lowest hanging fruit
Mocks  Stubs  Doubles
